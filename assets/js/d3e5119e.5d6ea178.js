Because there may never be such words to describe, how I\'ve fallen to you so dearly.\\nOr they just simply slip away when you get into the picture. However for quite some time now, these words have been hiding.\\nI hope it finds a way to get to you. I don\'t want to keep them forever, to no avail. It\'s just a message, a letter, a hymn of a heart genuine to its intention.\\nTo all the sense of it, it cannot live without.\\n\\nFor the one who conquered me, I am forever your colony. Like the golden times, you are immortal in my memory.\\nI wanted to believe, and I put all my faith to worship you. To you, I send my prayers... For the hopes of tomorrow and thank you for this life today.\\n\\nThat chance while I was with you, I appreciated every second, giving me a few times to dwell on those moments, for my heart to recall when you\'re not already with me.\\nI reminisce them where I can visit and live there momentarily. I\'ll treasure your pictures I have taken from the flashes of our time together.\\nI\'ll be staying with your memories, and live with them. Like to the thought always being told, Life is short, and I know, I can somehow get through.\\nI just have to count these years... and smile. For the reason that, all of the years to come... I am dedicating them all for you.\\nThrough all times, you are the one that keeps me alive. And up to this very moment, you are my life. Let it be the end of it.\\n\\nAll my hopes and reasons why I still have to keep going, it all comes down to you. For the causes, and things my heart keeps on believing.\\nContinuously beating for you, forever, it stays clueless that you\'ll never come.\\nSometimes, as I try to stop falling deeply, it is my world that halts with your every motion.\\nUnconscious, I am left out of nowhere without any emotion, only to realize that you\'re gone. Out of time, I don\'t know where I am right now.\\nI am lost, and almost none of hope, finding that place in your heart.\\nYet still, I don\'t care if I spend my whole life searching for an answer or even if I don\'t get there at all.\\nIn this dreams I revolve around you, because I am that stupid. And I don\'t want a way out. I bleed to be lost forever about the thoughts of you.\\n\\nFor all what is left, so I have to close my eyes just to see yours. And when I see through them, they seem like the sky to me.\\nIt pulls me in and easily I go empty. Calm and free, I desire to keep them... And at night they look like those of the stars we can never catch.\\nBut that reminds me I\'m still breathing. Like the north star, they are my direction, my way when I don\'t know where to go.\\nWhen all things go wrong, I\'ll just have to look up, and I remember you. You don\'t have to be here... never did.\\nThough you are not on my sight, my heart sees you. I just have to close my eyes, and my soul draws your face.\\nIt\'s such a pretty view I\'d almost forget what\'s real. I would disregard everything, and imagine.\\nIt\'s an illusion where I\'m indulged in, into your eyes where I\'m drowning. So I\'ll fight for my life today to make another day.\\nA more promising tomorrow, expecting a time when I may have a chance to feel the real thing. To see your eyes again, decorating my view.\\nI\'ll stare much more at you so I won\'t miss a thing, and I won\'t miss you.\\nSo together with the moon and the stars, I can sleep with a dream of you yet again, and finally drown there.\\n\\nKeep smiling. I know you are. Send them to me when I\'m in despair and disbelief.\\nFor whenever I think about how you smile, it all becomes light and warm. It is always the center of my attraction...\\nLike where the sun sits, your smile brightens everything. You make me alive, and everything around of me.\\nYou make this world so beautiful. It softens my heart at the arrests of thousand depressions.\\nAt the middle of all things, it is the center of my ideas. It is always the starting line to all my endeavors.\\nBecause all my aspirations, the real reason behind them... is you.\\n\\nIn countless ways, I fall into my knees with your charms. I can walk through pains and stand through storms, but I become weak and helpless in front of you.\\nLike a spell was casted upon I cannot break. That to you, I am so vulnerable, I have no resistance. Defenseless, you can occupy me into slavery.\\nYou can take everything away and I\'ll give them up with no hesitation. Without anything in return nor an expectation. You are my highness. You are my queen.\\n\\nYour name is something I will never forget, nor tire of whispering among the soft winds that become one with the world.\\nEach letter of it is like a piece of a puzzle. Put them all together and it completes my being.\\nWhen it is spoken, it softly turns to music as they come right to my ears.\\nWhen the winds whisper them, it carries my dreams to the sky, so I can kiss the heaven and afford a smile. It is as lovely as you.\\nThey may not find it in any book or vocabulary, but turn into my memory, it is the most special word, and maybe the only word it knows.\\n\\nAll the moments I had been with you, I memorized them. The happiest days of my life, it has been so good to remember.\\nSince then, everything changed. Around me, it is all about you. Naturally and effortless, you make me instantly content.\\nYou are the remedy to my insecurities. You are a prerequisite to happiness, and my only condition to survive. There is no any other.\\n\\nIf there is not a room for waiting, and nothing can save me, it doesn\'t matter.\\nIf ever I don\'t realize the right place or the right time, so to belong to you I plead, till the rest of my days.\\nAnd even though goodbyes are certain to happen, I just couldn\'t tell mine simply because I cannot live without you.\\nMaybe there will never be a right time. Reality goes, unacceptable though I already know. Sad to think I can\'t go anywhere.\\nI\'m stuck outside your door without any guarantee. It feels like forever, draining me, more difficult than being empty.\\nAnd to keep enduring them until I\'ve got nothing left.. I desire I can foretell, and be not in vain.\\nBut to have somehow known you, and felt you, is already magical.\\n\\nEnvious to them, I\'d give up everything if only I can be with you. My whole existence is on the line. That they are lucky.\\nBut if they start to hurt you, and everything goes wrong, just tell me... Because I would sell my soul just to see you happy.\\n\\nTake care of yourself, always.\\n\\nI hope you find what you\'re looking for."},{"id":"to-the-fullest-extent","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/to-the-fullest-extent","source":"@site/blogs/love-letters/2014-10-22-to-the-fullest-extent.md","title":"To the Fullest Extent","description":"By the edge of one night\'s dream, even before the morning sun, habitually there has been a pattern of","date":"2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 22, 2014","tags":[{"label":"love-letter","permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/tags/love-letter"}],"readingTime":3.045,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Randell Tuazon","title":"Dev/Poet/Writer","url":"https://www.instagram.com/randelltuazon","imageURL":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8d15e5eb3cd8eb14ada9c614f65cb4c53693993a98a784a05f0b2ba31e6bee46?size=128","key":"randelltuazon"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"to-the-fullest-extent","title":"To the Fullest Extent","authors":["randelltuazon"],"keywords":["randell tuazon","poetry","love letter"],"tags":["love-letter"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"An Unsent Love Letter","permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/an-unsent-love-letter"},"nextItem":{"title":"Absolution","permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/absolution"}},"content":"By the edge of one night\'s dream, even before the morning sun, habitually there has been a pattern of\\nwhat my mind does with itself. A natural occurrence that takes place I have already been accustomed to.\\nA vision or a future almost impossible that it refuses to accept; where only in its sleep can it distort what\'s\\nreal. In a land of love, a lost soul has found a home, and it continuously takes me there; too beautiful for\\nit to let go, that sooner I would have to regret I woke. I do not remember exactly how all of this began.\\nFor what I know, everything started when you happened, and my eyes first met yours.\\n\\nIt only took me just one good look at your smile, to cause my heart beat as twice, with all the pressure\\npressing it, and take my breath away. So I move around, to ease the feeling, only to behold more loveliness\\ncontained in you. You were beautiful in every angle. Suddenly it became a good piece of a memory. A\\nportrait in my mind, that reminds me, how beautiful that day was, and the days after. Then the scenes\\nbecame as magical in the witness of your every graceful walks. That I look at you and I believe in heaven,\\nthere you are an angel. You are this life\'s grandest prize. And sooner I notice, you were too far to reach;\\nand I would be wise to stay away but somehow and some way, I must keep a part of you.\\n\\nWe are worlds apart, but every now and then, you somehow manage to go across the other world where\\nI dwell, into my daydreams, uninvited even. In every idle time, you make me compose all these crazy thoughts.\\nFor no exact reason, I tire to wonder why. Way too many thoughts but simply put, that in my line of view, you\\nare a composition of how beautiful is defined and what it is to me; and what comes second is not even close.\\nYour flaws are attractions that make me smile, for those are what I love about you. And though I may speak a\\nlot of comparisons, to wonderful things however, I just want you to know, what value you have and how precious\\nyou are. In an overview, it unfolds the one that would make me completely whole, or empty. You are all I want to love.\\n\\nQuite, I don\'t understand, or maybe then I really do understand. For what you are to me could be like the way\\nI am to others. And what I am to you maybe is what you are to one man. That was all it was, I find it dense\\nbut I\'m still proud. Without expectation, I gave you all of my heart and whatever more I can give. My words\\nrather spoken, they can only be written; but that doesn\'t take away any of its truth. I always long to moving\\nforward, travel to find a home. But whatever path I take, you are where it leads me.\\n\\nYou are the unreachable, for a while I can only take a glimpse. I look upon, you are the highest of my dreams, of them all.\\n\\nAnd when you talk much and I can only listen, I loved hearing your voice and the way you speak. Often we talk\\nabout things that don\'t even matter, in the back of my mind, I\'m saying I love you... I love you with all my life.\\nAnd I do not know how to love you more, for I love you now to the fullest extent."},{"id":"absolution","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/absolution","source":"@site/blogs/love-letters/2014-07-10-absolution.md","title":"Absolution","description":"Before the journey even began, the thing I was already preparing for, and had been worrying and wondering","date":"2014-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 10, 2014","tags":[{"label":"love-letter","permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/tags/love-letter"}],"readingTime":3.06,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Randell Tuazon","title":"Dev/Poet/Writer","url":"https://www.instagram.com/randelltuazon","imageURL":"https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/8d15e5eb3cd8eb14ada9c614f65cb4c53693993a98a784a05f0b2ba31e6bee46?size=128","key":"randelltuazon"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"absolution","title":"Absolution","authors":["randelltuazon"],"keywords":["randell tuazon","poetry","love letter"],"tags":["love-letter"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"To the Fullest Extent","permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/to-the-fullest-extent"},"nextItem":{"title":"Reality","permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/reality"}},"content":"Before the journey even began, the thing I was already preparing for, and had been worrying and wondering\\nabout, is how it\'s going to end. No one else can commit to, I molded myself upon chasing all aspects of\\nperfection, in my own definition, in preparation for the greatest battle of my life.\\n\\nTo think it was the finest opportunity, in an overview I saw the most transparent look. One night, on the\\nother side of realm for an attempt to conquer with only little advantage, it was all darkness and a little light.\\nBut it is to me, as a declaration of freedom something worthy to die for. Once in my lifetime that I gave myself\\nnot a choice, but to pursue. Not even asking myself nor a second thought, I only trusted my instinct. It was\\nalmost a matter of win or lose, life or death. For the love of her.\\n\\nStanding still I ought to move to find the perfect approach. Equipping my faith with all courage it needed. The\\ndevotion was absolute. Clearing all the paths where I must walk, I was almost blind with each step. And i took\\nit like to the vision of what it was in my dreams, I didn\'t care much if it was false belief. I was in a hurry of chasing\\nthat vision, for the possibility may change over time and circumstances.\\n\\nBehind for almost all throughout the process, I was trailing in the deepest part. The odds are smaller but I had\\nto gamble. By any means I did to keep it close, with the hunt almost endless. Even at the last minute, I trailed,\\nthough I may have the last shot. In my grasp, is absolution or maybe desolation. It can\'t be stolen away, and I\\ntighten the grip to embrace the moment. Everything was like a slow motion scene, in a count-off, for a trade-off.\\nI took all the proper time. And I was set, to the final moment. i gasped, and under its way... and beyond and it goes.\\n\\nAs it was on, i was sure i let loose of it perfectly. and i thought about winning... I must. I held my breath slowly\\ngiving up air as it revealed the real worries of my heart. The world stopped for a moment. My eyes, closed, before\\nthe truth in front of me. Knees stumbling to the ground; too weak to face it, I was hoping it went on like I imagined it would be.\\n\\nTill it\'s time. The story has to be told. Slowly, I opened my eyes... and blurry for awhile. It took a second before\\nI finally realized. Though I knew it right from the start, my hope was floating, believing. To see is to believe, and I\\nbelieve it now. The attempt... rimmed out. My defeat was agreed upon from above. It seemed a waste of breath.\\nEverything for naught. Everything fell apart. Left speechless, my thought was, no matter when, no matter what, it may all\\nbe just the same.\\n\\nSaid and done, the fall was a good thing. The heaviness of the feelings and the intensity that went along with,\\nprobably are the best to happen in my entire life. And having that chance is a winner after all. It is the rightest\\nthing I have ever done. I fail for reasons but I don\'t make excuses. If there is something to realize, I know I already knew it right from the start. Risk my faith because I seek for freedom. I seek for the truth. I seek for the meaning of my life. There can really be no justice. Only absolution."},{"id":"reality","metadata":{"permalink":"/blogs/love-letters/reality","source":"@site/blogs/love-letters/2012-02-12-reality.md","title":"Reality","description":"There are those things we want to have.
