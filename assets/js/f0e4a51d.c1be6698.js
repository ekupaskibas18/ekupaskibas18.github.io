A\nportrait in my mind, that reminds me, how beautiful that day was, and the days after. Then the scenes\nbecame as magical in the witness of your every graceful walks.

Way too many thoughts but simply put, that in my line of view, you\nare a composition of how beautiful is defined and what it is to me; and what comes second is not even close.\nYour flaws are attractions that make me smile, for those are what I love about you. And though I may speak a\nlot of comparisons, to wonderful things however, I just want you to know, what value you have and how precious\nyou are.
