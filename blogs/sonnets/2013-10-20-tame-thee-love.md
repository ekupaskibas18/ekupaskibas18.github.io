## Tame Thee Love

When love commands oneself, and could not be tamed,  
And rage like wildfire, burning love one proclaimed.  
It spreads outrageously, and an unmindful risker,  
To substance it can crawl and burn together  
By where it stays perish, what none can uphold,  
Its span is as long only as it can hold  
Until useless all become, and all consumed,  
Too late to recover, when conscience resumed.  
So but tame thee love and discover its use,  
See clearly its uses, and give no excuse.  
Let it be the light and a solemn beginning  
Of the first step taken to be prevailing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Remember no matter little or severe,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Love may hurt only when oneself is unclear.*
