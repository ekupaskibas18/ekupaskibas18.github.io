Lovely is the morning, you are lovelier...<br/>
Like an angel divine has fallen here,<br/>
Spare me, what a vision oh my lucky charm<br/>
While I strive hard to look more seemingly calm.<br/>
Please, last the fading day, and althrough the night.<br/>
Remain from me alive, You by borrowed sight.<br/>
For uncertain tomorrows may be unblessed,<br/>
And lest I may ran out of your loveliness.<br/>
Through weekends' boredom I myself come weary,<br/>
A day none of you is only misery.<br/>
Most treasured You, never had but neither lost.<br/>
Beknown this lifetime we'll never come across.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Shall fate robs this, I can no longer accept.*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *For it's all I have of you and ever kept.*<br/>
