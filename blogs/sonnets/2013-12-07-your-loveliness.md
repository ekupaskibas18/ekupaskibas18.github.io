## Your Loveliness

Lovely is the morning, you are lovelier...  
Like an angel divine has fallen here.  
Spare me a vision of such a lucky charm,  
While I strive hard to look more seemingly calm.  
Please, last the fading day, and althrough the night,  
Remain from me alive, you by borrowed sight.  
For uncertain tomorrows may be unblessed,  
And lest I may ran out of your loveliness.  
Through weekends' boredom I myself come weary,  
A day none of you is only misery.  
Most treasured you, never had but neither lost.  
Beknown this lifetime we'll never come across.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Shall fate robs this, I can no longer accept.*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *For it's all I have of you and ever kept.*
