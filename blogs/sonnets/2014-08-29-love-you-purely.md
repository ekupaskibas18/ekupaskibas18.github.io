## Love You Purely

I love you without lust, nor doubts, nor demise,  
When a kiss in the cheek would even suffice.  
Each shared nights I care only to watch you sleep,  
Softly brushing your hair through my fingertips.  
I pray to be the right one such grace deserves.  
My appeal is not your beauty nor your curves.  
I have thousand fantasies, but none ill of you,  
I'd rather dream about us and smile afew.  
I'd carry all burdens when the worst demands,  
And in our sixties, we'd still be holding hands.  
My love is timeless, beyond the heart and soul,  
I'll love you even without hope, nor you at all.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Even if it may not always seem to show,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *I love you purely more than you ever know.*
