When love commands oneself, and could not be tamed, <br/>
And rage like wildfire, burning love one proclaimed, <br/>
That spreads outrageously, an unmindful risker, <br/>
To substance it can crawl and burn together. <br/>
By where it stays perish, what none can uphold, <br/>
Its span is as long only as it can hold. <br/>
Until useless all become, and all consumed, <br/>
Too late to recover, when conscience resumed. <br/>
So but tame thee love and discover its use, <br/>
See clearly its goodness, and give no excuse <br/>
Let serve light in the dark and be beginning <br/>
Of the first step taken to be prevailing. <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Remember no matter little or severe,* <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Love may hurt only when oneself is unclear.* <br/>
