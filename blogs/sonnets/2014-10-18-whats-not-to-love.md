## What's Not to Love?

If your concerns suspect of why I'm in love,  
Cast all the doubts away, for what's not to love?  
By voice of one remark reveals another,  
In no resolve with time begets more wonder.  
Of all your beauty, I confuse what's foremost,  
No compliment could suffice your doubts almost.  
As far as I know, you're so much lovable,  
Far beyond my league and insurmountable.  
But I do not love you because of reason  
Nor what attends presently at my vision,  
For my heart does not think, nor does mind to see.  
I'll love you still, be certain or mystery.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *But if you still protest, I would not say more,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Let me just confirm my love for keeps therefore.*
