If your concerns suspect of why I'm in love,<br/>
Cast do the doubts away, for what's not to love?<br/>
By voice of one remark reveals another,<br/>
In no resolve with time begets more wonder.<br/>
Of all your beauty, I confuse what's foremost<br/>
No compliment could suffice your doubts almost.<br/>
As far as I know, you're so much lovable,<br/>
Far beyond my league and insurmountable.<br/>
But I do not love you because of reason,<br/>
Nor what attends presently at my vision,<br/>
For my heart does not think, nor does mind to see<br/>
I'll love you still, be certain or mystery.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *But if you still protest, I would not say more,*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Let me just confirm my love for keeps therefore.*<br/>
