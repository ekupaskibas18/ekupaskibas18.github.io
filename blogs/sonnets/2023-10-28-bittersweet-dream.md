Let not my dream comprise you and be it sweet<br/>
When my desire hungers more throughout of sleep<br/>
Whilst stars write plots of perfect Love above all<br/>
By when you take and play my lovely wife's role.<br/>
A fool deceived, to be convinced 'tis heaven<br/>
Blinding me of a prize, fate has forbidden:<br/>
The warmth felt in your hand, softer as it grips<br/>
The sunrise in your smile, and delicate lips.<br/>
Such fragile qualities, I refuse to touch,<br/>
Content by sweet thoughts, though I desire so much.<br/>
'Till truth itself reveals, and the curtains close,<br/>
Bleed you my first thought when reality rose.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *If I dream another, and still find you there*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Then let it be my last, hence dream forever.*<br/>
