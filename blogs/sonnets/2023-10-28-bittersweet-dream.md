## Bittersweet Dream

Let not my dream comprise you and be it sweet,  
When my desire hungers more throughout of sleep.  
Whilst stars write plots of perfect Love above all,  
By when you take and play my lovely wife's role.  
A fool deceived, to be convinced 'tis heaven,  
Blinding me of a prize, fate has forbidden:  
The warmth felt in your hand, softer as it grips,  
The sunrise in your smile, and delicate lips.  
Such fragile qualities, I refuse to touch,  
Quenched in contentment, though I covet so much.  
'Till truth itself reveals, and the curtains close,  
Bleed you my first thought when reality rose.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *If I dream another, and still find you there*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Then let it be my last, hence dream forever.*
