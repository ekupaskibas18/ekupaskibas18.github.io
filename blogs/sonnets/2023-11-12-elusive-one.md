When in God's time I with you be introduced,<br/>
I'll urge perfection for such a perfect muse.<br/>
I'll cherry-pick the sweetest words, by fair chance<br/>
Align our first talk in sweet deliverance.<br/>
Yet I fear to try too much and please you none,<br/>
And be lost forever, my elusive one.<br/>
Or in regret be drowned of what might have been<br/>
That I spent the idle night, much into thinking.<br/>
And unto my excitements, my senses wake,<br/>
Out of overmuch preparations to make<br/>
Than be well-rested, had gotten weary instead<br/>
Rehearsing sweet thoughts bubbling over my head.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *But doubt this may and never bound to happen,*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *That I tire depend wishing things to Heaven.*<br/>
