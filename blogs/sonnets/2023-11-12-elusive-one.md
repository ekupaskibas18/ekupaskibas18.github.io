## Elusive One

When in God's time I with you be introduced,  
I'll urge perfection for such a perfect muse.  
I'll cherry-pick the sweetest words, by fair chance,  
Align our first talk in sweet deliverance.  
Yet I fear to try too much and please you none,  
And be lost forever, my elusive one.  
Or in regret be drowned of what might have been,  
That I spent the idle night, much into thinking.  
And unto my excitements, my senses wake,  
Out of overmuch preparations to make.  
Than be well-rested, had gotten weary instead,  
Rehearsing sweet thoughts bubbling over my head.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *But doubt this may and never bound to happen,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *That I tire depend wishing things to Heaven.*
