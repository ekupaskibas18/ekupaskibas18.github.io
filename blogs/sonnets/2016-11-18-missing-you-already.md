I love you in the most unselfish possible way. <br/>
Secretly, subtle, gentle and tame, <br/>
I love you in a way I am so much willing to suffer, <br/>
With a heart constantly breaking, day after day after day.<br/>
Without the idea of tomorrow and second chances, <br/>
Pure and always full of passion. <br/>
I love you beyond words, before myself and above all, <br/>
Every little now and then. <br/>
By sweet thoughts of you, there's a pinch in the heart,<br/>
Of the certain downfall, but my heart so neverminds.<br/>
I'll love you still even when you don't<br/>
And even if I get lost, you will always be my home.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Soon, all of this will be a bittersweet memory,*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *You're still here, but I'm missing you already.*<br/>
