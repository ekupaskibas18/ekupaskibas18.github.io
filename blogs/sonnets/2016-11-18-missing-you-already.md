## Missing You Already

I love you in the most unselfish possible way,  
Secretly, subtle, gentle and tame.  
I love you in a way I am so much willing to suffer,  
With a heart constantly breaking, day after day after day.  
Without the idea of tomorrow and second chances,  
Pure within and always full of passion.  
I love you beyond words, before myself and above all,  
Every little now and then.  
By sweet thoughts of you, there's a pinch in the heart,  
Of the certain downfall, but my heart so neverminds.  
And even if I get lost, you will always be home.  
I'll love you still even when you don't.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Soon, all of this will be a bittersweet memory,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *You're still here, but I'm missing you already.*
