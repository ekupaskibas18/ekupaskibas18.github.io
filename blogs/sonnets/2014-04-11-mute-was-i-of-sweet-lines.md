## Mute Was I of Sweet Lines

None more so to say, swayed I in an instant.  
My day rises at presence of your radiance.  
I beseech heaven draw forth all these jitters,  
That then I find myself lost in deeper prayers.  
Yours is a beauty resembling a goddess,  
Sustained upon perfectly at all angles.  
My eyes troubled into looking straight with yours,  
For I'll be melting, and more my heart implores  
All the beauty safe contained in those graces,  
But mute was I of any sweet lines and phrases.  
Knownst you barely, doubt me if it's all true.  
It is but madness, I cannot say I love you.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *And torn with regrets, what ifs and whatnot,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Would I've been any better to have earned your heart?*
