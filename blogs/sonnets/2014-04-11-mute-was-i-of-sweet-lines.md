None more so to say, swayed I in an instant<br/>
My day rises at presence of your radiance.<br/>
I beseech heaven draw forth all these jitters,<br/>
That then I find myself lost in deeper prayers.<br/>
For yours is a beauty resembling a goddess,<br/>
Sustained upon perfectly at all angles.<br/>
My eyes troubled into looking straight with yours,<br/>
For I'll be melting, and more my heart implores<br/>
All the beauty safe contained in those graces,<br/>
But mute was I of any sweet lines and phrases.<br/>
Knownst you barely, doubt me if it's all true,<br/>
It is but madness, I cannot say I love you.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *And torn with regrets, what ifs and whatnot,*<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *Would I've been any better to have earned your heart?*<br/>
