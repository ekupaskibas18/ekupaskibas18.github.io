I love you without lust, nor doubts, nor demise,<br/>
When a kiss in the cheek would even suffice.<br/>
Each shared nights I care only to watch you sleep,<br/>
Softly brushing your hair through my fingertips.<br/>
I pray to be the right one such grace deserves,<br/>
My appeal is not your beauty nor your curves.<br/>
I have a thousand fantasies, but none of you,<br/>
I'd rather dream about us and smile afew.<br/>
I'd carry all burdens when the worst demands,<br/>
And in our fifties, we'd still be holding hands.<br/>
For my love is timeless, beyond heart and soul,<br/>
I'll love you even without hope, nor you at all.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if it may not always seem to show,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love you purely more than you ever know.<br/>
