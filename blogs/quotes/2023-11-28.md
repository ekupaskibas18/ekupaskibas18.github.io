Somehow and often, there are no perfect answers to the questions of life.
The decision what to believe in what is right or real is always ours.
Sometimes, to resolve something, *we just have to leave it right there at the corner, unanswered.*
Sooner or later at their own right time, all the answers will reveal themselves.
Or maybe, we would then find out it was never really answered, because we didn't need to.
*We realize that we don't need the answer anymore.*
