<br/><br/><br/>

We're stuck in the mornight and empty bottles,  
In our blurry minds even, come read my tells.  
Share one little secret, and I'll whisper another back.  
Until there's nothing else to do but fuck.  
Save the consequences for later,  
We'll deal with all of it after.  
Do tease me that may we again be situated same,  
Don't test me, you know I'm always game.
