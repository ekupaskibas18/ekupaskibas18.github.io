<br/><br/><br/>

In a house full of drunks, and cheats and loud sound,  
Hardly the place where love's likely to be found.  
I was the lone man sober, and yet more mad,  
Glued in one corner by myself, seeming odd.  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *While all men were looking for the easy one to fuck,*  
&nbsp;&nbsp; *There I was a fool, waiting and looking for love.*
