<br/><br/>

I'll marry you anywhere an altar stands,  
and all our favourite beaches with white sands.  
With vows of loving you, old and anew,  
My eternal drops of morning dew.  
I'll marry you everyday on our quiet gardens,  
On our short dates, and long trips.  
Remind you each day how much I love you.  
Will you?
