On our short dates, and long trips. <br>
Will you go with me? <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Past my thirties, I admit I feel like I'm still not ready. <br>
I am far from perfection, by my own standards. <br>
I don't want to be that good guy today, and fool around ten years after. <br>
And I've seen enough good guys turn to monsters. Most of them are friends. <br>
Or maybe I'm just overly ambitious, always in pursuit of greatness. <br>
Or I became too tough that I can live alone. <br>
And maybe I'll never be perfect nor ready. <br>
I will only have to settle on admiring you afar. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

For you, I'll always be dreamin'. <br>

Hardly the place where love's likely to be found. <br>

While all men were looking for the easy one to fuck, <br>

It's a long list of countless reasons I have already lost track of. <br>
Maybe it is your grace, my perfect preference of a lady. <br>
Or maybe it is your beauty, such is my eye candy. <br>
I can give you thousand reasons more, <br>
and while all of them would be true, the fact is, I fancy you. <br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Of calm night's expressionless mystery <br>
You're the face of a pretty scenery <br>
Nothing more than lovelier could eclipse <br>
What's been enthroned by the shape of thy lips <br>
In a borrowed light, shone awe-inspiring <br>
No other thing can be more comforting <br>
Out of thrill by the promise of the night <br>
You glow complement to each candlelight <br>
As every stars behind you cast romance <br>
In light music time's perfect for a dance <br>
For every night, you are my sky's essence <br>
Surely I will miss you in your absence <br>
In touch of a dream, so near yet so far <br>
That in your standards I remain subpar <br>
But my admiration has not an end <br>
Like the horizon's depth on its extend <br>
Reaching infinity at its embrace <br>
I'd look beyond upon search for your trace <br>
Because without you, happiness falls short <br>
Pages blank float, life is without a worth <br>
And might this forever be left empty <br>
I shall remember in my memory <br>
Exclusively you've taken, none could fill <br>
Preserved not even end of time could kill <br>
For thy fairness rare is without replace <br>
In constant state of my eyes' steady gaze <br>
Let me wait patiently for this feature <br>
The face of my future, in-love and demure <br>
And for all-time be remained kept sweetest <br>
Your memories, eternal Love's purest. <br>
I know might you be ill to pledges by men, <br>
Take mine for it will never be broken. <br></p><p>If ever your own sky abandons you <br>
This you might know, someone out there loves you. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>
