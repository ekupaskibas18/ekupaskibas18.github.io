<p>Don't be afraid to make mistakes, <br>
and understand when people make them, too. <br>
The caveat is to <em><strong>never make the same mistakes twice.</strong></em> <br></p>

<p>Don't chase perfection. <br>
Rather, settle for good enough. <br>
Be comfortable by finding contentment, <br>
then improve in increments. <br>
Eventually, it'll come close to perfection. <br></p>

<p>When I finally meet you, what should I say? <br>
Should I tell you how lovely you are? <br>
For which you might have already heard countless of times, <br>
From men you thought to be all the same. <br>
So... no. I want to tell you something different <br>
Sweetest words and yet without losing truth. <br>
I hope I could make you smile <br>
With lively stories even it's embarassing. <br>
And this would be the start of a beautiful love story. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

I am far from perfection, by my own standards. <br>
I don't want to be that good guy today, and fool around ten years after. <br>
And I've seen enough good guys turn to monsters. Most of them are friends. <br>
Or maybe I'm just overly ambitious, always in pursuit of greatness. <br>
Or I became too tough that I can live alone. <br>
And maybe I'll never be perfect nor ready. <br>
I will only have to settle on admiring you afar. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>
