I can be your true love, or your one-night-stand. <br>

I can be your everything. <br>
I can be anything you want me to be. <br>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Past my thirties, I admit I feel like I'm still not ready. <br>
I am far from perfection, by my own standards. <br>
I don't want to be that good guy today, and fool around ten years after. <br>
And I've seen enough good guys turn to monsters. Most of them are friends. <br>
Or maybe I'm just overly ambitious, always in pursuit of greatness. <br>
Or I became too tough that I can live alone. <br>
And maybe I'll never be perfect nor ready. <br>
I will only have to settle on admiring you afar. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

Dress like James Bond. Fight like Statham. <br>
Think like Steve Jobs. Style like Johnny Depp. <br>
Act like a gentleman. <br>
Write like Hank Moody. Live like Larry Crowne. <br>
Play like Michael Jordan. Drive like Vin Diesel. <br>
Train like The Rock. Chase the Dream, <br>
and Beat that Zucker. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

But you're too good to be true, it's surreal. <br>
That's how I knew it's just a fucking dream, but still. <br>
For you, I'll always be dreamin'. <br>
Because I am a dreamer, and you are mine. <br>
Come again, and don't ever wake me up. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a house full of drunks, and cheats and loud sound, <br>
Hardly the place where love's likely to be found. <br>
I was the lone man sober, and yet more mad, <br>
Glued in one corner by myself, seeming odd. <br>
While all men were looking for the easy one to fuck, <br>
There I was a fool, waiting and looking for love. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do I admire you? But why even bother asking? <br>
It's a long list of countless reasons I have already lost track of. <br>
Maybe it is your grace, my perfect preference of a lady. <br>
Or maybe it is your beauty, such is my eye candy. <br>
I can give you thousand reasons more, <br>
and while all of them would be true, the fact is, I fancy you. <br>
And I don't even really know why. <br></p>]]></content:encoded>
