So it was just a dream. Still felt like so god damn real. <br/>
But you're too good to be true, it's surreal. <br/>
That's how I knew it's just a fucking dream, but still. <br/>
For you, I'll always be dreamin'. <br/>
Because I am a dreamer, and you are mine. <br/>
Come again, and don't ever wake me up. <br/>
