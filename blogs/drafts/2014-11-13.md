In a house full of drunks, and cheats and loud sound, <br/>
Hardly the place where love's likely to be found. <br/>
I was the lone man sober, and yet more mad, <br/>
Glued in one corner by myself, seeming odd. <br/>
While all men were looking for the easy one to fuck, <br/>
There I was a fool, waiting and looking for love. <br/>
