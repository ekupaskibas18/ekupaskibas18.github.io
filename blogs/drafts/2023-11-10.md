Past my thirties, I admit I feel like I'm still not ready. <br />
I am far from perfection, by my own standards. <br />
I don't want to be that good guy today, and fool around ten years after. <br />
And I've seen enough good guys turn to monsters. Most of them are friends. <br />
Or maybe I'm just overly ambitious, always in pursuit of greatness. <br />
Or I became too tough that I can live alone. <br />
And maybe I'll never be perfect nor ready. <br />
I will only have to settle on admiring you afar. <br />
