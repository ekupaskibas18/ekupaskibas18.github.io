Why do I admire you? But why even bother asking? <br/>
It's a long list of countless reasons I have already lost track of. <br/>
Maybe it is your grace, my perfect preference of a lady. <br/>
Or maybe it is your beauty, such is my eye candy. <br/>
I can give you thousand reasons more, <br/>
and while all of them would be true, the fact is, I fancy you. <br/>
And I don't even really know why. <br/>
