Of calm night's expressionless mystery <br/>
You're the face of a pretty scenery <br/>
Nothing more than lovelier could eclipse <br/>
What's been enthroned by the shape of thy lips <br/>
In a borrowed light, shone awe-inspiring <br/>
No other thing can be more comforting <br/>
Out of thrill by the promise of the night <br/>
You glow complement to each candlelight <br/>
As every stars behind you cast romance <br/>
In light music time's perfect for a dance <br/>
For every night, you are my sky's essence <br/>
Surely I will miss you in your absence <br/>
In touch of a dream, so near yet so far <br/>
That in your standards I remain subpar <br/>
But my admiration has not an end <br/>
Like the horizon's depth on its extend <br/>
Reaching infinity at its embrace <br/>
I'd look beyond upon search for your trace <br/>
Because without you, happiness falls short <br/>
Pages blank float, life is without a worth <br/>
And might this forever be left empty <br/>
I shall remember in my memory <br/>
Exclusively you've taken, none could fill <br/>
Preserved not even end of time could kill <br/>
For thy fairness rare is without replace <br/>
In constant state of my eyes' steady gaze <br/>
Let me wait patiently for this feature <br/>
The face of my future, in-love and demure <br/>
And for all-time be remained kept sweetest <br/>
Your memories, eternal Love's purest. <br/>
I know might you be ill to pledges by men, <br/>
Take mine for it will never be broken. <br/>

If ever your own sky abandons you <br/>
This you might know, someone out there loves you. <br/>
