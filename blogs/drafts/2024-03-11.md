  <div class="text-sm mt-16 mb-10 text-green-700 font-fragment-mono">> advice to dev teams that are also true in life:</div>
</header>

Don't chase perfection. <br />
Rather, settle for good enough. <br />
Be comfortable by finding contentment, <br />
then improve in increments. <br />
Eventually, it'll come close to perfection. <br />
