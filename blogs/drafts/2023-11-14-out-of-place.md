## Out of Place

When I meet you, what should I say? <br/>
Should I tell you how love you are? <br/>
For which yyou might have already heard countless of times <br/>
From men you thought to be all the same. <br/>
So... no. I want to tell you something different <br/>
Sweetest words and yet without losing truth. <br/>
I hope I could make you smile <br/>
With lively stories even it's embarassing. <br/>
And this would be the start of our love story. <br/>
To which we can tell our little kids, <br/>
How wonderfully we have met. <br/>
