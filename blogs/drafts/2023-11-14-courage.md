I am obvious and surely you must know, <br/>
I admire you. <br/>
And when I find the courage, <br/>
I shall speak to you all the sweetest things. <br/>
Maybe I'll sweep you off your feet, <br/>
or you can destroy all of me in just a single word. <br/>
Whatever it will be, i won't mind. <br/>
Only when I find that courage. <br/>
