By the edge of one night's dream, even before the morning sun, habitually there has been a pattern of
what my mind does with itself. A natural occurrence that takes place I have already been accustomed to.
A vision or a future almost impossible that it refuses to accept; where only in its sleep can it distort what's
real. In a land of love, a lost soul has found a home, and it continuously takes me there; too beautiful for
it to let go, that sooner I would have to regret I woke. I do not remember exactly how all of this began.
For what I know, everything started when you happened, and my eyes first met yours.

It only took me just one good look at your smile, to cause my heart beat as twice, with all the pressure
pressing it, and take my breath away. So I move around, to ease the feeling, only to behold more loveliness
contained in you. You were beautiful in every angle. Suddenly it became a good piece of a memory. A
portrait in my mind, that reminds me, how beautiful that day was, and the days after. Then the scenes
became as magical in the witness of your every graceful walks. That I look at you and I believe in heaven,
there you are an angel. You are this life's grandest prize. And sooner I notice, you were too far to reach;
and I would be wise to stay away but somehow and some way, I must keep a part of you.

We are worlds apart, but every now and then, you somehow manage to go across the other world where
I dwell, into my daydreams, uninvited even. In every idle time, you make me compose all these crazy thoughts.
For no exact reason, I tire to wonder why. Way too many thoughts but simply put, that in my line of view, you
are a composition of how beautiful is defined and what it is to me; and what comes second is not even close.
Your flaws are attractions that make me smile, for those are what I love about you. And though I may speak a
lot of comparisons, to wonderful things however, I just want you to know, what value you have and how precious
you are. In an overview, it unfolds the one that would make me completely whole, or empty. You are all I want to love.

Quite, I don't understand, or maybe then I really do understand. For what you are to me could be like the way
I am to others. And what I am to you maybe is what you are to one man. That was all it was, I find it dense
but I'm still proud. Without expectation, I gave you all of my heart and whatever more I can give. My words
rather spoken, they can only be written; but that doesn't take away any of its truth. I always long to moving
forward, travel to find a home. But whatever path I take, you are where it leads me.

You are the unreachable, for a while I can only take a glimpse. I look upon, you are the highest of my dreams, of them all.

And when you talk much and I can only listen, I loved hearing your voice and the way you speak. Often we talk
about things that don't even matter, in the back of my mind, I'm saying I love you... I love you with all my life.
And I do not know how to love you more, for I love you now to the fullest extent.
